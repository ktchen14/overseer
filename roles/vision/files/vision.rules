# The vendor:product identifier of the USB 3.0 hub in each Dell U2718Q monitor
# is 0424:2734 as in:
#
#   Bus ... Device ...: ID 0424:2734 Standard Microsystems Corp.
#
# An individual device of this type is impossible to distinguish in isolation as
# all attributes amongst such devices are identical (no serial number is
# available). Thus we have to distinguish each device using its port location on
# its immediate parent (the switchable hub). From experience the port numbers on
# the switchable hub are stable and align to its physical ports like:
#
#   --      ---      ---      ---      --
#   | Port 1 | Port 2 | Port 3 | Port 4 |
#   |===================================|
#
# The vendor:product identifier of the switchable USB 3.0 hub is 05e3:0610 as
# in:
#
#   Bus ... Device ...: ID 05e3:0610 Genesys Logic, Inc. 4-port hub
#
# However the port number that a USB device is on isn't exposed as an attribute
# in udev (or rather it isn't exposed in the uevent). Even if it was available
# udev doesn't have any method to retrieve information from a device's immediate
# parent. The only location that this information is available is in the kernel
# name of the device itself (from http://www.linux-usb.org/FAQ.html#i6):
#
#   The (USB) devices are named by a scheme like this:
#     bus-port.port.port ...
#   The name starts with the bus number followed by a '-'. Then comes the
#   sequence of port numbers for each of the intermediate hubs along the path to
#   the device.
#
# So if the switchable hub's kernel name is 1-2 then the devices attached to it
# have kernel names 1-2.1 through 1-2.4.
#
# To handle this situation when the switchable hub is added we save its kernel
# name to a file `/run/vision/switch`. Then when a device accessible from the
# switchable hub is added, to determine if it's directly attached to port `n` of
# the switchable hub, we test if its kernel name is the switchable hub's kernel
# name (from `/run/vision/switch`) concatenated with `.n`.

# When the switchable hub is added to the system save its kernel name to
# `/run/vision/switch`
